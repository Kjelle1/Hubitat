# Installation
You need to install the Verisure Alarm driver which is the **parent** driver resposible for creating and updating the child devices. Then install the child drivers corresponding to your needs.

After this you only create **ONE** device and set device type to Verisure Alarm. As Verisure is restricting the calls to their unofficial mobile API to a maximum of one per minute it is recommended to create a additional user in *Verisure My Pages* and use the credentials in the driver!
